# alzheimers-biomarkers_apoe4
Alzheimer disease (AD) is the most prevalent type of dementia, accounting for at least two-thirds of cases in individuals aged 65 and older. It is a neurodegenerative condition with insidious onset and progressive impairment of behavioral and cognitive functions. 

I use the open dataset ‘Plasma lipidomics in Alzheimer’s Disease’ to analyse the implications of CSF biomarkers and genotype on AD, and integrate the results with insights from relevant studies to provide biological context, to highlight the significance of developing targeted therapies in neurodegeneration research.  

Key tools -- 

Statistical tests (T and Z tests, ANOVA, Tukey)  

Data visualization (boxplots, heatmaps)  

Python libraries (pandas, seaborn, scipy, statsmodels)

Major Findings -

Amyloid-β and tau significantly differ with AD severity, and levels can be used to indicate late-onset AD in Minor Cognitive Impairment cases
ApoE4 allele seems to be the most influential factor for AD, especially in late-onset AD due to its effects on Aβ and tau pathology,
